  ]
}

Guidelines:
1.  **Main Theme First:** Focus entirely on identifying the single MOST specific `main_theme` pattern name using standard textile terminology (e.g., Floral, Geometric, Paisley, Plaid, Stripe, Polka Dot, Damask, Ikat, Batik, Abstract, Conversational, Animal Print, Border, Toile, etc.). If highly specific (e.g., 'Art Deco Geometric', 'Baroque Damask'), use that.
2.  **Internal Reasoning Hint:** Before deciding the `main_theme`, internally consider the overall layout (e.g., repeating motif, all-over design, edge/border element, linear arrangement).
3.  **Confidence Score:** Provide a realistic `main_theme_confidence` reflecting your certainty based *only* on the visual evidence. Use 'Unknown' for `main_theme` only if the pattern is completely unrecognizable or genuinely ambiguous, assigning low confidence.
4.  **Key Elements:** List only 1-3 of the most prominent and defining visual motifs in `content_details`. Be specific about the element type (e.g., 'Rose', 'Triangle', 'Acorn') and its main color(s) (e.g., 'Pink', 'Blue/Yellow', 'Brown'). Provide confidence for each element.
5.  **Secondary Patterns:** Only list distinct, secondary patterns if they are clearly present and different from the main theme. Otherwise, omit or use an empty list `[]`.
6.  **3D Texture Analysis:** You MUST carefully analyze the image for signs of 3D elements:
   - Set `is_3d` to TRUE only when you can clearly see: embossing, raised patterns, quilting, dimensional textures, or other clear indicators that the pattern physically extends beyond a flat surface
   - Set `is_3d` to FALSE for flat printed patterns, digital designs, and illustrations without physical dimension
   - Look carefully at shadows, lighting variations, and depth cues that indicate physical dimensionality
   - In your texture_description, always describe the physical characteristics regardless of dimensionality
7.  **Keywords (STRICT LIMIT - 5 MAX):** Provide EXACTLY 1-5 keywords MAXIMUM. Each keyword should be a single word or short phrase. This is a STRICT limit - never exceed 5 keywords under any circumstances.
8.  **JSON Output Only:** Respond ONLY with the valid JSON object described above. No introduction, explanation, apologies, or any other text outside the JSON structure."""

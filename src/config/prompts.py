{
  "main_theme": "<string>",
  "main_theme_confidence": <float between 0 and 1>,
  "content_details": [
    { "name": "<detailed element description>", "confidence": <float between 0 and 1> },
    … (2 to 5 items)
  ],
  "secondary_patterns": [
    { "name": "<string>", "confidence": <float between 0 and 1> },
    …
  ],
  "style_keywords": ["<string>", …],
  "prompt": { "final_prompt": "<comprehensive summary of the image including key motifs, colors, textures, and style notes>" }
}

Guidelines:
1. Dynamically identify the primary pattern using the most specific and descriptive term possible (e.g., "tropical floral", "damask", "patchwork"). Only assign a specific pattern when you are highly confident; otherwise, return "Unknown."
2. Extract and list 2–5 key visual elements (motifs) that are clearly visible in the image. For each element:
   - Provide a detailed description that includes the element's type (e.g., leaf, flower, geometric shape), its dominant color(s) (using precise color names such as "vivid red", "azure blue", "emerald green"), and any visible texture (e.g., smooth, rough, intricate, dappled).
   - Ensure that every element is described with clarity and specificity without omission of critical details.
3. Identify any secondary patterns present in the image. Even if they are less dominant than the primary pattern, list them along with a confidence score.
4. Generate a final prompt that integrates all the major motifs, dominant colors, texture details, and style notes to fully encapsulate the visual essence of the image. This summary should be concise yet comprehensive.
5. Use clear, normalized, and technical terminology. Avoid vague descriptors; if uncertain, opt for "Unknown" instead of generic guesses.
6. Validate and sanitize all confidence values so they are floats between 0 and 1.
7. Do not include any extra commentary or text. Respond solely with the valid JSON output following the structure described above.

Respond only with the valid JSON output."""
